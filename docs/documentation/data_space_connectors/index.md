title: Overview

Currently, only two data space connector technologies can be considered prominent: **Eclipse** and **Fiware**. On the other hand, **Simpl**, which is based on Eclipse technologies, is still in its early stages of development. As it progresses, Simpl aims to leverage the foundational strengths of Eclipse to provide a final product solution within the data space connector landscape in the EU.

Below, we provide an analysis of each alternative and an introductory guide to testing the software.
